# Katy Trail App

In effort of preserving the Katy Trail history, we have developed this app that will inform users of historical sites on the trail when approaching specific areas. Users can also read about the locations from the app itself.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to build the project so it can be published onto the Google Play Store or Apple App Store.

### Hardware Requirements

If you plan to run this app on a real mobile device, here are the hardware requirements:
- iPhone running iOS 10 or later
- Android 4.0 or later

### Prerequisites

An installation of the Flutter framework and Dart SDK is required. Instructions to installing Flutter can be found [here](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).

To test the app on Android, you must also install the Android SDK and Android Studio. Installing Android Studio should also install the Android SDK, which you can find the installer [here](https://developer.android.com/studio).

> Note: If your computer is using a Ryzen AMD processor and you wish to use an emulator, you must download the Beta version of Android Studio instead which can be found [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/preview).

If you wish to test the app on iOS, you'll need to install Xcode from the App Store.
